This AI chatbot project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras to create an intelligent conversational agent. The NLTK library is used for tokenizing and lemmatizing words, while an intents file defines the chatbot's patterns and responses. Data preprocessing involves normalizing and converting sentences into a bag-of-words format. The neural network model, consisting of dense and dropout layers, is trained on this processed data. It predicts the class of user input and generates appropriate responses based on the highest probability intents. The chatbot can understand various inputs and respond accurately, demonstrating the integration of NLP and deep learning in creating sophisticated conversational agents
